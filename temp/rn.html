<b>Note : Thunderbird v148 has fixed the issue with PDF Export</b><br><br>

I have reconsidered my support for the release channel. With around 78k users, I don't want to disrupt them. Also I want everyone for the beta and 
release of v15 which is a complete rewrite of the 
export messages functions. After the next ESR release I will decide on my release policy.<br>
however, please check for ImportExportTools NG support before	updating Thunderbird.
